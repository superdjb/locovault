	‚Ä¢	Beneath each card‚Äôs main image ‚Üí 2‚Äì3 thumbnails that link to the ‚Äúback of card‚Äù views.

‚∏ª

Card Details (Front + Back)

Front of Card (always visible)
	‚Ä¢	Large image of the loco
	‚Ä¢	Key details in neat rows:
	‚Ä¢	Maker
	‚Ä¢	Model name/number
	‚Ä¢	Scale
	‚Ä¢	Era
	‚Ä¢	Date purchased

Back of Card (expanded view / thumbnails)
	‚Ä¢	Additional details categories (placeholders in MVP):
	‚Ä¢	Prototype history (short text snippet or notes)
	‚Ä¢	CV/DCC chip settings (configurable values list)
	‚Ä¢	Notes / condition (free text)
	‚Ä¢	Additional photos (thumbnail gallery)

‚∏ª

Authentication
	‚Ä¢	Mandatory login: users must sign up or log in to access collection features.
	‚Ä¢	Sign Up / Log In:
	‚Ä¢	Simple email + password for MVP.
	‚Ä¢	Centered card-style modal form with clean styling.
	‚Ä¢	Future upgrade: social login (placeholder).

‚∏ª

User Features
	‚Ä¢	Basic (free):
	‚Ä¢	Log locos with photo + basic info fields (Maker, Model, Number, Scale, Date purchased).
	‚Ä¢	Browse collection in card format.
	‚Ä¢	Advanced (subscription/purchase TBD):
	‚Ä¢	Add extended fields (CV/DCC chip settings, prototype notes, extra photos).
	‚Ä¢	Sharing/community features.
	‚Ä¢	For MVP: show placeholders/upgrade banners where advanced features will go.

‚∏ª

Data Categories Reference
	‚Ä¢	Use www.locoshed.com as a reference site for comprehensive data categories (classes, liveries, allocations, service dates, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	For MVP: only include the basics (Maker, Model, Number, Scale, Date purchased, Era).
	‚Ä¢	Structure the app so additional categories can be added later without redesigning the cards.
